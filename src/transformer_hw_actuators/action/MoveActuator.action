# Goal: synchronously command one or more actuators.
# actuators: list of actuator indices to command together (unique, valid indices)
# speed_percents: same length as actuators, signed speeds (-100..100)
# duration_ms: optional per-actuator durations; if length==1 apply to all; if length==0 treat as immediate (set speed & return); if provided with length==actuators.size() each actuator runs that long then stops.
# If an actuator has duration <=0 it is treated as immediate.
