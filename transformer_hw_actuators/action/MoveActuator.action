# Goal: set actuator speed with sign indicating direction.
# speed_percent is clamped to [-100, 100]. 0 = stop (coast by default).
# duration_ms > 0 makes the motor run for that duration and then stop.
 # If duration_ms <= 0, the motor is set and the action returns immediately.

int32 actuator         # 0 or 1
int32 speed_percent    # -100..100 (sign = direction)
int32 duration_ms      # milliseconds to run at speed; <=0 means no timing
